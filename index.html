    <p>React is a JavaScript library with the purpose to simplify the development of visual interfaces.</p>
    <p>According to Flavio (see below), its primary goal is to make reasoning about an interface and its state at any point in time easy by dividng the UI into a collection of components.</p>
    <p>It was developed at Facebook and powers both Facebook and Instagram as well as numerous other applications. It was publicly released in 2013.</p>
    
    <p>Disclaimer: This is not supposed to be a comprehensive dive into React. It does not even cover all the ground required as an overview to get started with the library: Styling, tooling and testing are all concepts which are covered here. For all of that and more <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> have a look at the official React website</a> and <a href="https://pages.convertkit.com/96341da1b1/f37b562c91">please refer to Flavio Copes' "Handbook to React"</a>, both of which served as a basis for the content of this website. This fCC project I really just created so I myself could get a first glimpse into React.</p>
    
    <h2>The popularity of React</h2>
    <p>Ever since its release into the world, React has enjoyed widespread popularity for three main reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Simplicity of use, also for existing projects</li>
      <li>Ideal release date</li>
      <li>Facebook loves it</li>
    </ul>
    Let's dive into each of them in turn.</p>
    
    <h3>Less complex than the other alternatives</h3>
    <p>In contrast to the libraries that existed before (Ember.js and Angular 1.x), React was purposefully designed so it would be easy to integrate it into existing projects. Facebook had to do it this way in order to introduce it to their existing codebase. Additionally, React's creators decided to only implement the View Layer. Ember.js and Angular 1.x, by contrast, the predominant frameworks at the time, not only used the full MVC stack but also imposed a lot conventions on any projects that wanted to use them. Using them in an existing project wasn't convenient at all.<br><a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">For information on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture see Martin Fowler's website.</a></p> 
    
    <h3>Perfect timing</h3>
    <p>Additionally, when React was published, Google had just announced Angular 2.x and the new Angular framework was so wildly different from Angular 1.x that moving from 1 to 2 was "like moving to a different framework". React also provided a certain execution speed that developers were eager to try.</p>
    
    <h3>Backed by Facebook</h3>
    <p>Being backed by Facebook obviously is going to benefit a project if it turns out to be
successful. Facebook currently has a strong interest in React, sees the value of it being Open Source, and this is a huge plus for all the developers using it in their own projects.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Use_React">
    <header>Use React</header>
    
    <p>Here is the manual of how to add React.js to your website in just one minute. Courtsey of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">official React website's instructions</a>. </p>
    <h1>Step 1: Add a DOM container to the <code>html</code> file</h1>
    
    <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <div> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React.</p>
    
    <code>
      <xmp>
<!-- ... existing HTML ... -->

<div id="like_button_container"></div>

<!-- ... existing HTML ... -->
      </xmp>
    </code>
    
    <p>Make sure to give the <code>div</code> a unique <code>id</code>. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later and display a React component inside of it.</p>
    <p>Tip from the React team: You can place a “container” <code>div</code> like this anywhere inside the <code>body</code> tag. You may have as many independent DOM containers on one page as you need. They are usually empty — React will replace any existing content inside DOM containers.</p>
    
        <h1>Step 2: Add the <code>script</code> tags</h1>
        
        <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Right before the end of the <code>body</code> element, add two script tags:</p>
        <code>
          <xmp>
 <!-- ... other HTML ... -->

  <!-- Load React. -->
  <!-- Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js". -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>

  <!-- Load our React component. -->
  <script src="like_button.js"></script>

</body>
          </xmp>
        </code>
    
    <h1>Step 3: Create a React component</h1>

<p>Create a file called <code>like_button.js</code> next to your HTML page.</p>

<p>Paste the following starter code into the JS file you just created. (<a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/gaearon/0b180827c190fe4fd98b4c7f570ea4a8/raw/b9157ce933c79a4559d2aa9ff3372668cce48de7/LikeButton.js">The starter code for a like button in React is also available here.</a>)</p>

<code>
  <xmp>
    'use strict';

const e = React.createElement;

class LikeButton extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { liked: false };
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.liked) {
      return 'You liked this.';
    }

    return e(
      'button',
      { onClick: () => this.setState({ liked: true }) },
      'Like'
    );
  }
}
  </xmp>
</code>

<p>After the starter code, add two lines to the bottom of <code>like_button.js</code></p>

<code>
  // ... the starter code you pasted ...

const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');
ReactDOM.render(e(LikeButton), domContainer);
</code>

<p>These two lines of code find the <code>div</code> we added to our HTML in the first step, and then display our “Like” button React component inside of it.</p>
    
<p>Well done, you! You have just added the first React component to your website.</p>

    <p>The people of React have created a tutorial to teach you React, over the course of which you are going to build your own tic tac toe game. The good news is that you don't need to know any React beforehand - you are going to learn it as you go along.</p>
    
    <p>The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of React.</p>
