    <h1>React</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
    
    <p>React is a JavaScript library with the purpose to simplify the development of visual interfaces.</p>
    <p>According to Flavio (see below), its primary goal is to make reasoning about an interface and its state at any point in time easy by dividng the UI into a collection of components.</p>
    <p>It was developed at Facebook and powers both Facebook and Instagram as well as numerous other applications. It was publicly released in 2013.</p>
    
    
    <p>Disclaimer: This is not supposed to be a comprehensive dive into React. It does not even cover all the ground required as an overview to get started with the library: Styling, tooling and testing are all concepts which are covered here. For all of that and more <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> have a look at the official React website</a> and <a href="https://pages.convertkit.com/96341da1b1/f37b562c91">please refer to Flavio Copes' great "Handbook to React"</a>, which also served me as a basis for the content of this website. This fCC project I really just created so I myself could get a first glimpse into React.</p>
    
    <h2>The popularity of React</h2>
    <p>Ever since its release into the world, React has enjoyed widespread popularity for three main reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Simplicity of use, also for existing projects</li>
      <li>Ideal release date</li>
      <li>Facebook loves it</li>
    </ul>
    Let's dive into each of them in turn.</p>
    
    <h3>Less complex than the other alternatives</h3>
    <p>In contrast to the libraries that existed before (Ember.js and Angular 1.x), React was purposefully designed so it would be easy to integrate it into existing projects. Facebook had to do it this way in order to introduce it to their existing codebase. Additionally, React's creators decided to only implement the View Layer. Ember.js and Angular 1.x, by contrast, the predominant frameworks at the time, not only used the full MVC stack but also imposed a lot conventions on any projects that wanted to use them. Using them in an existing project wasn't convenient at all.<br><a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">For information on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture see Martin Fowler's website.</a></p> 
    
    <h3>Perfect timing</h3>
    <p>Additionally, when React was published, Google had just announced Angular 2.x and the new Angular framework was so wildly different from Angular 1.x that moving from 1 to 2 was "like moving to a different framework". React also provided a certain execution speed that developers were eager to try.</p>
    
    <h3>Backed by Facebook</h3>
    <p>Being backed by Facebook obviously is going to benefit a project if it turns out to be
successful. Facebook currently has a strong interest in React, sees the value of it being Open Source, and this is a huge plus for all the developers using it in their own projects.</p>

    <header>Use React</header>
    
    <p>You can start using React, either by
      <ul>
        <li>loading it directly into a webpage in the <code>html</code> section or</li>
        <li>use <code>create-react-app</code> </li>
        <ul>
          <br>Let's look at each of those two options in turn.</p>
